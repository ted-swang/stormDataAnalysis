# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 2


## Loading and preprocessing the data
First, we load some libraries we will be using for this analysis


```r
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
```

We next load the data into R, assuming the data file is in the same directory as this document.


```r
stormDataFilename <- "stormData.csv.bz2"
stormDataInit <- read.csv(stormDataFilename)
```

After reading in the data, we take a look at the first few rows of the dataset (there are 902297).

```r
dim(stormDataInit)
```

```
## [1] 902297     37
```


```r
stormDataInit %>% tbl_df %>% head
```

```

```

For this analysis, we are answering questions about population health and economic consequences of weather, so we extract only the data we need for this analysis, namely data where  fatalities, injuries, property damage, or crop damage are strictly greater than 0. We select columns correponding to this data, along with the event type.


```r
stormData <- stormDataInit %>%
        tbl_df %>%
        mutate(Year = year(mdy_hms(BGN_DATE))) %>%
        select(
                Year,
                EventType = EVTYPE, 
                Fatalities = FATALITIES, 
                Injuries = INJURIES, 
                PropertyDamage = PROPDMG, 
                PROPDMGEXP, 
                CropDamage = CROPDMG, 
                CROPDMGEXP
                ) %>%
        filter(
                Fatalities > 0 | 
                Injuries > 0 | 
                PropertyDamage > 0 | 
                CropDamage > 0
                )
```

The variables `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMGEXP` give us a multiplicative factor for dollars of damage caused by a weather event. We treat "H" to mean hundred, "K" thousand, "M" million, "B" billion, and numeric values as scientific notation exponents (i.e. "2" corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 10^2), we prepare the columns PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP for numerical calculation. We use the `fct_collapse` function from the `forcats` package to make these columns uniform and numeric. For rows missing data in these columns, we assume the value is 0. 


```r
stormData$PROPDMGEXP <- stormData$PROPDMGEXP %>% 
        fct_collapse(
                "0" = c("0", "", "+", "-", "?"),
                "2" = c("h", "H", "2"),
                "3" = c("K", "3"),
                "6" = c("M", "m", "6"),
                "9" = c("B")
                ) %>%
        as.character %>%
        as.numeric

stormData$CROPDMGEXP <- stormData$CROPDMGEXP %>% 
        fct_collapse(
                "0" = c("0", "", "?"),
                "3" = c("K", "k"),
                "6" = c("M", "m"),
                "9" = c("B")
        ) %>%
        as.character %>%
        as.numeric
```

Now we compute the dollar values of the `PropertyDamage` and `CropDamage` columns, and get rid of the `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMGEXP` columns.


```r
stormData <- stormData %>% 
        mutate(PropertyDamage = PropertyDamage*(10^PROPDMGEXP), CropDamage =  CropDamage*(10^CROPDMGEXP)) %>%
        select(-PROPDMGEXP, -CROPDMGEXP)
```

We now want to get an idea of common types of weather events listed.


```r
table(stormData$EventType) %>% sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>% head(10)
```

```
## 
##          TSTM WIND  THUNDERSTORM WIND            TORNADO 
##              63234              43655              39944 
##               HAIL        FLASH FLOOD          LIGHTNING 
##              26130              20967              13293 
## THUNDERSTORM WINDS              FLOOD          HIGH WIND 
##              12086              10175               5522 
##        STRONG WIND 
##               3370
```

We immediately notice a problem: the values of `EventType` may use different names to describe the same type of event (notice, for instance, the top two event: `TSTM WIND` and `THUNDERSTORM WIND`). To remedy this, We first define variables that group together names of similar factors.


```r
## factor names for tornado related factors, including waterspouts, dust devils, and whirlwinds

```

We use the function `fct_collapse` from the `forcats` package to consolidate our `EventType` factor vector


```r
stormData$EventType <- fct_collapse(stormData$EventType,
                TSTORM = TStormFactors,
                TORNADO = TornadoFactors,
                HEAT = HeatFactors,
                FLOOD = FloodFactors,
                TROPSTORM = HurricaneFactors,
                WINTERSTORM = WinterStormFactors,
                WIND = WindFactors,
                FIRE = FireFactors,
                HAIL = HailFactors,
                COLD = ColdFactors,
                FOG = FogFactors, 
                MARINE = MarineFactors,
                RAIN = RainFactors, 
                LANDSLIDE = LandslideFactors,
                DRY = DryFactors,
                OTHER = OtherFactors
                )
```

Finally, let's get a summary of our data


```r
stormDataSummary <- stormData %>% 
        group_by(EventType) %>%
        summarize(
                Fatalities = sum(Fatalities), 
                Injuries = sum(Injuries), 
                PropertyDamage = sum(PropertyDamage), 
                CropDamage = sum(CropDamage)
                )
```

Let's now take a look at our processed data.


```r
stormData
```
